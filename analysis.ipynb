      "business model for many years where it operated two separate lines of business —\n",
      "InfoSpherix and BioSpherix.  In\n",
      "accordance with the business plan, InfoSpherix earned enough money to support\n",
      "itself and BioSpherix.  This allowed\n",
      "InfoSpherix to grow while supplying funds for the research and development\n",
      "efforts of the BioSpherix Division, which focused on developing\n",
      "healthcare-related products. By mid-2004, management\n",
      "believed that this model would soon have to change.  The product mix in InfoSpherix was shifting\n",
      "away from the commercial sector to a less profitable government sector.  Clients were beginning to require that the\n",
      "Company fund the upfront costs for information projects and recover the cost\n",
      "over the life of the project.  Also, our\n",
      "BioSpherix products were far enough along where continued development would\n",
      "soon require significant capital.  In\n",
      "addition, equity investors interested in BioSpherix did not understand InfoSpherix\n",
      "and its purpose.  Therefore, responsible\n",
      "investors were more difficult to attract. \n",
      "Our InfoSpherix clients became concerned about our focus on this\n",
      "business and they questioned our long-term commitment to the business.  Also, our bank stated that it was not\n",
      "interested in funding biotechnology research. \n",
      "Therefore, they required the Company to secure its line of credit with\n",
      "cash in lieu of receivables and other fixed assets.  Financing for capital equipment was becoming\n",
      "harder to attract.  As a result, at the\n",
      "February 17, 2005 meeting, the Board of Directors decided it was time to split\n",
      "the two divisions and require each one to be self-funding.  On June 8, 2005, the stockholders approved\n",
      "the establishment of InfoSpherix Incorporated as a wholly-owned subsidiary of\n",
      "Spherix.  Subsequently, on January 1,\n",
      "2006, InfoSpherix began operating as an independent subsidiary. 6 In December 2005, the FDA\n",
      "gave Spherix final permission to conduct a Phase 3 clinical trial for Naturlose\n",
      "as a treatment for Type 2 diabetes.  The\n",
      "Company signed agreements with independent contract research organizations to\n",
      "conduct the Phase 3 trial and engaged another entity to assist in the\n",
      "development and monitoring of the trials and to consult on FDA issues.  Although initial estimates developed by\n",
      "Spherix and the above consultants indicated we had sufficient capital to\n",
      "complete the trial, the Board and management became concerned about long-term\n",
      "financing.  A manufacturing source needed\n",
      "to be found and, should complications develop in our Phase 3 trial, final FDA\n",
      "approval of the protocol could result in significant additional capital\n",
      "needs.  In addition, it was becoming\n",
      "clear that InfoSpherix also needed capital to develop next generation products. In the spring of 2006,\n",
      "Active Network approached the Company expressing an interest in the reservation\n",
      "portion of the InfoSpherix business and the Company held some preliminary\n",
      "discussion with the Active Network during the next few months.  On June 27, 2006, a meeting of the Executive\n",
      "Advisory Committee of the Board was held in Cumberland, Maryland.  The Committee discussed a potential sale of\n",
      "all or part of the InfoSpherix subsidiary, along with the use of funds from\n",
      "this sale and any settlement of our National Park Service dispute.  The Committee agreed that it was premature to\n",
      "make a decision as to whether any sale of InfoSpherix was desirable.  However, the Committee decided that if a sale\n",
      "was ever to be pursued, a sale of the entire subsidiary was preferential and\n",
      "that other potential buyers should be sought. On November 17, 2006, the\n",
      "Company received a letter through its FDA consultant requiring additional\n",
      "expenditures on its Phase 3 clinical trial. \n",
      "At this point it was becoming apparent that the Phase 3 trial was going\n",
      "to be more expensive than first thought. Also on November 17,\n",
      "2006, the Company received an unsolicited Letter of Intent (LOI) from Active\n",
      "Network.  The LOI was for the purchase of\n",
      "the entire information business.  The Board\n",
      "met on November 21, 2006.  After review\n",
      "of the LOI from The Active Network, the Board declined the offer.  Discussions were held on the need to raise\n",
      "more capital, even with the $6 million settlement related to the National Park\n",
      "Service.  The rising cost of the Phase 3\n",
      "trial was discussed along with the need to complete the anti-plaque study of\n",
      "Naturlose at the University of Maryland. \n",
      "Several methods of raising capital were discussed, but no final decision\n",
      "was made. A special Board Meeting\n",
      "was held on January 8, 2007.  The\n",
      "immediate need to raise capital was discussed and the President was authorized\n",
      "to seek equity funding for $12-15 million to fund the BioSpherix Division.  In addition, further discussions were held to\n",
      "consider the possibility of selling InfoSpherix as a means of raising cash. SC&H Capital\n",
      "Corporation (“SC&H”), a consulting firm with merger and acquisition\n",
      "experience, was engaged on January 29, 2007, to assist the management team in\n",
      "exploring a sale of InfoSpherix.  On\n",
      "March 6, 2007, the Board of Directors created an Evaluation Committee\n",
      "consisting of three outside directors appointed to provide SC&H with\n",
      "guidance in the process and to avoid any actual or perceived conflicts of\n",
      "interest. During the first several\n",
      "months of 2007, the President met with several investment bankers about the\n",
      "possibility of raising capital.  It was\n",
      "decided that, given the current stock price and early phase of the Phase 3\n",
      "clinical trial, an equity offering would not be prudent at this time. On April 13, 2007, a\n",
      "Board Meeting was held to review the capital raising alternatives.  In the course of reviewing these\n",
      "alternatives, SC&H reviewed the process it had conducted with management to\n",
      "that point.  Contact had been made with\n",
      "approximately 100 companies, including both strategic and financial targets,\n",
      "through the use of a blind profile which outlined the InfoSpherix\n",
      "opportunity.  This campaign ultimately\n",
      "resulted in approximately 10 management presentations provided to various\n",
      "interested parties.  The above activities\n",
      "yielded four Letters of Intent, including a revised offer from The Active\n",
      "Network.  One of the Letters of Intent\n",
      "was ultimately withdrawn.  SC&H\n",
      "prepared a comparison of each of the Letters of Intent and presented it to the\n",
      "Evaluation Committee.  A discussion of\n",
      "the possible terms and requirements of a deal ensued. Pursuant to a\n",
      "recommendation from the Evaluation Committee, the Board concluded that a sale\n",
      "of InfoSpherix was in the best interests of Spherix and the Board approved a\n",
      "resolution to accept the offer from Active Network as proposed.  The Evaluation Committee was given the\n",
      "authority to approve any changes to the LOI consistent with the discussions. 7 Subsequent negotiations,\n",
      "led by the management team and outside counsel, were held with The Active\n",
